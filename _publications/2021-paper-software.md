The concurrency control algorithm is a key approach for a database system to guarantee the correctness and efficiency of transaction execution. Thus far, substantial effort has been devoted to proposing new concurrency control algorithms in both the database industry and academia. In this paper, we take the lead in summarizing the fundamental ideas of concurrency control algorithms as“ordering-and-verifying”. We then redescribe and sort out the existing concurrency control algorithms following the ordering-and-verifying paradigm. On the basis of extensive comparative experiments on an open-source main-memory distributed transaction testbed called 3TS, we systematically investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the mainstream concurrency control algorithms and finally summarize the preferable application scenario for each algorithm to provide valuable references for follow-up research on concurrency control algorithms used in main-memory databases.
